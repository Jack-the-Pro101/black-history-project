            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <div class="paragraph-box">
                Sylvia D. Hamilton was born in Beechville, Nova Scotia, Canada, however for some reason there is no mention of her birthdate anywhere online. From her getting a bachelor’s degree from Acadia University in 1972: meaning that she was probably around 20 at that time, I can assume she was born around 1950. She has not passed away yet, and if assuming she was born in 1950, would be currently 71 years old.<br/><br/>

                Hamilton grew up in a Black community just outside of Halifax, Nova Scotia which was a black community that was founded by refugees from the War of 1812. She was the second youngest of six of Gerald and Marie Hamilton. As a child, she was taught by her mother in segregated schools (meaning people of different races were taught apart). When she was in high school (non-segregated), she noticed that the descriptions of Black people in textbooks and in the media rarely actually reflected on her experience. Hamilton became Beechville’s first highschool graduate when she completed high school, and went on to get a bachelor’s degree from Acadia University in 1972, and a master’s degree from Dalhousie University in 2000.

                Sylvia Hamilton works as an independent filmmaker in her company called Maroon Films (she produces, directs, and researches everything for the film herself). Hamilton uses film to spread awareness and document about blacks in Canadian history, focusing mainly on women. She has served “as a volunteer on many boards and committees including the advisory board for Dalhousie University’s Transition Year Program (TYP) and itsIB&M (Indigenous Black and Mik’Maq) Law School Program both of which serve First Nations and African Canadian students”. She even worked for the secretary of race relations and was the co-founder of the New Initiatives in Film (NIF) Program, which was a program created opportunities for black women and First Nation women to create films as filmmakers. Obviously, Hamilton is very dedicated to spreading awareness and helping descrimination of races since a young child, doing everything in her power to do so, which I think should be celebrated. Considering her time period of when she grew up, where people of her color were looked down upon and discriminated against, it is amazing how much she denied this and contributed.

            <div class="one-word">
                I would describe Hamilton in one word as: <span style="font-weight: bold;">dedicated.</span> <br><br>
                One question I would ask her if I could is: where she got the extreme perseverance to speak out against discrimination from.
